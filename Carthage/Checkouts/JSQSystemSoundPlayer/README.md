*A fancy Obj-C wrapper for Cocoa [System Sound Services](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AudioToolbox/Reference/SystemSoundServicesReference/Reference/reference.html), for iOS and OS X.*

## About

This library is a light-weight component to play sound effects in your app.
To determine your audio needs, see [Best Practices for iOS Audio](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/AudioVideo/Conceptual/MultimediaPG/UsingAudio/UsingAudio.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009767-CH2-SW10).

**tl;dr**
>*When your sole audio need is to play alerts and user-interface sound effects, use Core Audioâ€™s System Sound Services.*
>
>Your sound files must be:
>
>* No longer than 30 seconds in duration
>* In linear PCM or IMA4 (IMA/ADPCM) format
>* Packaged in a `.caf`, `.aif`, or `.wav` file

If this does not fit your needs, then this library is not for you!
See [AVAudioPlayer](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/AVFoundation/Reference/AVAudioPlayerClassReference/Reference/Reference.html), instead.

* Caches sounds (`SystemSoundID` instances) and purges on memory warning
* Works with Swift!

## Requirements

* iOS 6.0+
* OS X 10.7+
* tvOS 9.0+
* ARC

## Installation

### [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) (recommended)
````ruby
pod 'JSQSystemSoundPlayer'
````

### [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

````bash
github "jessesquires/JSQSystemSoundPlayer"
````

## Getting Started

````swift
@import JSQSystemSoundPlayer;
````

#### Playing sounds

````objective-c
[[JSQSystemSoundPlayer sharedPlayer] playSoundWithFilename:@"mySoundFile"
                                             fileExtension:kJSQSystemSoundTypeAIF
                                                completion:^{
                                                   // completion block code
                                                }];
````

String constants for file extensions provided for you:
* `kJSQSystemSoundTypeCAF`
* `kJSQSystemSoundTypeAIF`
* `kJSQSystemSoundTypeAIFF`
* `kJSQSystemSoundTypeWAV`

#### Toggle sounds effects settings on/off

Need a setting in your app's preferences to toggle sound effects on/off? `JSQSystemSoundPlayer` can do that, too! There's no need to ever check the saved settings (`[JSQSystemSoundPlayer sharedPlayer].on`) before you play a sound effect. Just play a sound like in the example above. `JSQSystemSoundPlayer` respects whatever setting has been previously saved.

````objective-c
[[JSQSystemSoundPlayer sharedPlayer] toggleSoundPlayerOn:YES];
````

#### Specifying a bundle

Need to load your audio resources from a specific bundle? `JSQSystemSoundPlayer` uses the main bundle by default, but you can specify another.

**NOTE:** for each sound that is played `JSQSystemSoundPlayer` will **always** search the **last specified bundle**. If you are playing sound effects from multiple bundles, you will need to specify the bundle before playing each sound.

````objective-c
[JSQSystemSoundPlayer sharedPlayer].bundle = [NSBundle mainBundle];
````

#### Demo project

The included example app, `Example.xcodeproj`, exercises all functionality of this framework. There are applications for iOS as well as OS X.
